## Why You Should Know This (5 min)

Choices made during the software construction process heavily affect your project and team.

## Learning Objectives (5 min)

1. Identify and describe the steps in formal software construction.
2. Define
3. Design
4. Implement

## Initial Exercise (15 min)

Read through **[Avoiding Classic Mistakes (pdf)](https://2h73ayp5jhv44aq9p3zmp9gd-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/ClassicMistakes.pdf)** --- learn how to **shield your team from classic software engineering mistakes**. Food for thought for the entire term!

## Overview/TT I (30 min)

### What is Software Construction?

Formal software construction contains many surprising steps!

* Problem definition
* Requirements development
* Construction planning
* Software architecture, or high-level design
* Detailed design
* Coding and debugging
* Unit testing
* Integration testing
* Integration System testing
* Corrective maintenance

If you've worked on projects in an informal environment --- like hackathons or intensives --- you might *think* this list represents a lot of process. If you've received your first internship, you've experienced the kind of red tape this process involves in real life!

Engineering excellent software products means **striking the right balance** in your workflow, and we'll explore that throughout the term.

### Why is Software Construction Important?

### Choosing a Programming Language and Why it Matters

### Selecting a Convention to Follow

### Tracking How it Affects the Project/Team

### Choosing a Construction Practice That Fits

## BREAK (10 min)

## In Class Activity I

### Discuss and Reflect (30 min)

1. Get into pairs. **Choose someone who wasnâ€™t in your team last term**.
     1. Discuss the choices your team made in Term 3:
     2. Did your team follow conventions? Which? How did conventions, or the lack thereof, affect your team throughout the term?
     3. How did your team choose what programming language(s) and frameworks to use on the project?
     4. What changes could enhance your experience as a developer?

## In Class Activity II

### Discover (30 min)

1. Ask pairs to join into groups of four.
1. Ask pairs to find and research a few development standards from various companies.
      1. Examples:
            1. Lyft
            2. Medium
            3. *Use [stackshare.com](https://stackshare.com) to find more companies you admire to research!*
2. Compare and contrast the choices these teams made.
