## Why You Should Know This (5 min)

Your understanding of how to construct software **determines how good a programmer you are**.

## Learning Objectives (5 min)

1. Identify and describe the steps in formal software construction.
2. Define
3. Design
4. Implement

## Initial Exercise (15 min)

Read through **[Avoiding Classic Mistakes (pdf)](https://2h73ayp5jhv44aq9p3zmp9gd-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/ClassicMistakes.pdf)** --- learn how to **shield your team from classic software engineering mistakes**. Food for thought for the entire term!

## Overview/TT I (30 min)

### What is Software Construction?

Formal software construction contains many surprising steps!

* Problem definition
* Requirements development
* Construction planning
* Software architecture, or high-level design
* Detailed design
* Coding and debugging
* Unit testing
* Integration testing
* Integration System testing
* Corrective maintenance

If you've worked on projects in an informal environment --- like hackathons or intensives --- you might *think* this list represents a lot of process. If you've received your first internship, you've experienced the kind of red tape this process involves in real life!

Engineering excellent software products means **striking the right balance** in your workflow, and we'll explore that throughout the term.

#### The Work in Real Life

What does Software Construction look like in real life?

* Verifying that the groundwork has been laid so that construction can proceed successfully
* Determining how your code will be tested
* Designing and writing classes and routines
* Creating and naming variables and named constants
* Selecting control structures and organizing blocks of statements
* Unit testing, integration testing, and debugging your own code
* Reviewing other team members' low-level designs and code and having them review yours
* Polishing code by carefully formatting and commenting it
* Integrating software components that were created separately
* Tuning code to make it faster and use fewer resources

#### That's Everything, Right?

A lot goes into building a software project. Here's some important non-construction activities that engineers may participate in:

* Management
* Requirements development
* Software architecture
* User-interface design
* System testing
* Maintenance

Each of these activities affects the ultimate success of a project as much as construction! At least the success of any project that calls for more than one or two people and lasts longer than a few weeks.

### Why is Software Construction Important?

Air traffic control. Medical imaging. The Mars rover. Twilio.

What do all these things have in common? They rely on software!

As engineers, improving our software quality and productivity is of utmost importance, even when flying solo. Nearly everything we experience today is a result of some kind of software! Construction is a large part --- the *central activity* --- in software development, and the product of software construction --- the *source code* --- is often the only complete and accurate description of the software.

### Choosing a Programming Language and Why it Matters

### Selecting a Convention to Follow

### Tracking How it Affects the Project/Team

### Choosing a Construction Practice That Fits

## BREAK (10 min)

## In Class Activity I

### Discuss and Reflect (30 min)

1. Get into pairs. **Choose someone who wasnâ€™t in your team last term**.
     1. Discuss the choices your team made in Term 3:
     2. Did your team follow conventions? Which? How did conventions, or the lack thereof, affect your team throughout the term?
     3. How did your team choose what programming language(s) and frameworks to use on the project?
     4. What changes could enhance your experience as a developer?

## In Class Activity II

### Discover (30 min)

1. Ask pairs to join into groups of four.
1. Ask pairs to find and research a few development standards from various companies.
      1. Examples:
            1. Lyft
            2. Medium
            3. *Use [stackshare.com](https://stackshare.com) to find more companies you admire to research!*
2. Compare and contrast the choices these teams made.
